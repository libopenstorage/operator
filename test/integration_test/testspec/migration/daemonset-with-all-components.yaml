              creationTime:
                description: creationTime is the timestamp when the point-in-time snapshot is taken by the underlying storage system. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the snapshot controller with the "creation_time" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshot" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "creation_time" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. If not specified, it may indicate that the creation time of the snapshot is unknown.

              error:
                description: error is the last observed error during snapshot creation, if any. This field could be helpful to upper level controllers(i.e., application controller) to decide whether they should continue on waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error reported. The snapshot controller will keep retrying when an error occurrs during the snapshot creation. Upon success, this error field will be cleared.
                properties:
                  message:
                    description: 'message is a string detailing the encountered error during snapshot creation if specified. NOTE: message may be logged, and it should not contain sensitive information.'

              readyToUse:
                description: readyToUse indicates if the snapshot is ready to be used to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the snapshot controller with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshot" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise, this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.
                type: boolean
              restoreSize:
                type: string
                description: restoreSize represents the minimum size of volume required to create a volume from this snapshot. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the snapshot controller with the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshot" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail. If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.
